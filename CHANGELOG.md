# Changelog

All notable changes to DS-Hns. Newest first. Each entry names the user-visible
behaviour that changed, not the files that were touched.

## merging — GitHub CI gate repaired

The repository's `verify` workflow (Windows, Node 22) failed on every push. Two
independent causes, both real product bugs rather than CI configuration:

- **The balance module could strand a refresh on a hanging provider.** The
  per-provider deadline timer was created with `unref()`, so it did nothing to
  keep the event loop alive. When a provider never answered and the wait for it
  was the only pending work, the process could exit with the timeout still
  unsettled — Node reports that as *"Promise resolution is still pending but the
  event loop has already resolved"*. The timer is now referenced, so the race
  always settles within the provider deadline; the shell's explicit exit paths
  still decide when DS-Harness goes away.
- **A sub-worker teardown could wait out its whole timeout.** `stop()` polled the
  pool for a drain with `unref()`-ed timers while the supervisor tick could still
  respawn a worker (or while the worker's own `exit` event had simply not been
  observed yet), so it either polled for the full 5 s or never settled at all.
  The pool now notifies waiters when a worker exits, `stop()` latches the pool as
  stopping before it waits, and `tick()` refuses to act during a teardown — the
  drain completes in milliseconds, and the timeout remains only as a safety net.

The tests are also repaired, so the gate measures the product rather than the
machine:

- `tests/unit/multi-supervisor.test.js` had a missing `})`: everything from the
  integration test down was parsed as a nested subtest of the pressure test,
  which is why Node 22 reported them cancelled. The file now parses as 13 tests.
- The same file pins a synthetic hardware profile in its rig, so the pool ceiling
  is no longer 1 on a 2-vCPU CI runner; the ceiling *derivation* against real and
  synthetic facts stays covered by `multi-profiler.test.js`.
- The workflow documentation now states why the Node version is pinned instead of
  floating (the suite is verified on 22 and 24).

## merging — Sub-worker execution layer merged in

`merging` now carries every line of development that is not `main`:
the Sub-worker / adaptive multi-worker layer (`Sub-worker`), on top of the theme,
skills, updater and acceptance work that `UI-theme`, `auto-update` and `skills`
had already contributed. Nothing was dropped: the whole merge was resolved by
keeping both features where they collided, and the merged tree passes the syntax
gate, the unit/architecture suite, the real Electron acceptance and the
Sub-worker's own end-to-end acceptance.

Fixed while integrating (both features were individually correct, only the
combination was not):

- The Sub-worker **Live View** push read `dockWindow.webContents` directly, so the
  integrated dock never received it and the "no direct dockWindow reads"
  architecture check failed. It now goes through the dock target adapter.
- `scripts/sub-worker-acceptance.cjs` copied `app/` recursively and hit `EPERM` on
  the `node_modules` link; it now skips `node_modules` and `data` (it links the
  dependency tree and starts from a fresh data directory anyway), and it copies the
  repository-level `assets/` too — without the tray icon its scratch shell ran in a
  degraded state that has nothing to do with what those scenarios verify.
- Its integration-merge check waited for the integration worktree *directory*
  while the merged files land a moment later, which made it flaky. It now waits
  for the files themselves.
- `scripts/verify.ps1` and the Sub-worker regression test asserted the old
  `HARNESS_PORT` expression; both now assert the shipped
  `normalizeHarnessPort()` / `DSH_LAUNCH_ARGS` behaviour.

## merging — stabilization pass

Fixes the confirmed design and implementation gaps on `merging` before it can be
merged to `main`. No new user-facing features; the theme, dock, updater, skills
and acceptance surfaces are made to actually close their loops.

### Self-update rollback (P0)

- **Upgrade and rollback are now two operations.** The rollback no longer reuses
  the upgrade command, so it can never re-install the version that just failed:
  it restores `app/package.json` and `app/package-lock.json` and runs
  `npm ci --no-audit --no-fund` (falling back to a plain `npm install` only when
  there is no lockfile to restore — and never with the target version).
- **The previous installation is identified from disk.**
  `app/node_modules/@deepseek-ai/dsh/package.json` decides what "the old version"
  is; the manifest pin is only a fallback. Every update records a transaction
  (`fromVersion`, `targetVersion`, `installedVersion`, manifests, `startedAt`).
- **Three outcomes instead of two.** `data/state/mega-update.json` now reports
  `succeeded`, `failed_rolled_back` or `failed_rollback_failed`, with the rollback
  result and its error code. The dock shows a distinct, high-visibility
  "回滚未完成，当前安装可能已损坏" state instead of a generic update failure.
- **Verification is real.** The upgrade is verified by installed version, CLI
  entry *and* a `node lib/bin.js --help` boot check; the rollback is verified by
  the restored version.

### Integrated Dock target adapter (P1)

- New `app/extensions/mega/dock/target.js`: one adapter
  (`getWebContents`, `getBounds`, `getSize`, `getVisible`, `capturePage`, `send`,
  `getState`) over the integrated `WebContentsView` and the legacy companion
  `BrowserWindow`. Theme repaint, change pushes, skills pushes, region probes and
  screenshots all go through it; the extension no longer reads `dockWindow` for
  any of them.
- The shell hands the extension a `dockAdapter` instead of a bare webContents, and
  reports dock-ready through `ctx.onDockReady`, which closes the boot gap where
  the first theme paint had no target yet (the view is created after extensions
  start). The callback is re-run when the dock renderer reloads.
- Dock state now carries `mode` (`integrated` / `window` / `detached`) and real
  view geometry, so the theme system never has to infer the UI from a null window.
- Dock toggles push their layout decision to the shell, so the reserved strip is
  actually re-laid out when the dock expands or collapses.

### Theme visual observation (P1)

- New `app/extensions/mega/theme/visual-artifact.js` validates captures: PNG
  signature, IHDR dimensions, and a size floor scaled to the image. A returned
  buffer that is not a usable image is rejected, not counted.
- The snapshot package now records `visual`, `degraded`, `visual_expected`,
  `visual_reason`, `capture_problems` and per-file verdicts. A structure-only
  design is still allowed, but it can no longer be silent: the theme create
  result, the log and the acceptance run all see the degraded state and its
  reason.
- `snapshot.screenshots` is now a page → file-name map (the previous shape mixed
  buffers into the package and broke persistence).
- The live slot-geometry probe is actually invoked before an observation, so the
  observer gets real bounding boxes instead of the last pushed cache.

### Acceptance and tests (P1)

- Acceptance asserts the visual observation: `snapshot.visual === true`,
  `degraded === false`, a real PNG per claimed file (>5 KB, valid header,
  non-zero dimensions), observed slot count > 0 with real bounding boxes, and the
  updater rollback suite. The report now carries `commit`, `branch`, `warnings`
  and per-`modules` counts.
- New tests: `dock-target` (integrated and legacy backends, destroyed targets,
  throwing adapters), `theme-visual-observation` (real capture, empty capture,
  junk buffer, capture exception, allowed degradations),
  `theme-model-adapter`, `encoding-integrity` (guards against a lossy
  encode/decode round-trip), and the rewritten `update-runner` A–E suite whose npm
  stub really rewrites `package.json` on `--save-exact`.
- `npm run check` is now `scripts/check-syntax.cjs`, which checks every shipped
  source file instead of a hand-maintained command list.

### Tooling

- `.github/workflows/verify.yml` runs the syntax gate and the test suite on
  Windows and Linux for pushes and pull requests to `main` and `merging`.
- `scripts/verify.ps1` gained architecture checks for the dock adapter, the
  absence of direct `dockWindow` reads, the split upgrade/rollback operations and
  the distinct rollback outcomes.
- Optional `app/extensions/mega/theme/model-adapter.js` prepares the AI designer
  layer: disabled by default, always falling back to the deterministic
  interpreter, reported in the theme status.
